# 1 Introduction
For this lab we were assigned to get familiar with testing coverage tools, were we used EclEmma. By using different techniques in this lab to decide which test cases must be developed, compared to previous assignments we used white-box testing in order to improve coverage for previously developed test cases. Furthermore, during the design phase we took a look at the DataUtilities.calculateColumnTotal and Range.contains class to manually develop data flow coverage. Lastly we showcase the DU-pairs per variable, showing the coverage from the previous assignments test cases.

For each test case show which pairs are covered:
Test Case 1: calculateColumnTotalForTwoValues
Input: values = 7.5, 2.5, column = 0


Execution Path:
Line 1: Mocking values.getRowCount() returns 2, meaning there are two rows.
Line 3: Mocking values.getValue(0, 0) returns 7.5 for the first value in the first row.
Line 5: Mocking values.getValue(1, 0) returns 2.5 for the second value in the second row.
Line 6: The method proceeds to accumulate the sum.
Line 8: The total sum (7.5 + 2.5) is 10.0.
Line 9: The method returns 10.0.


Covered DU-Pairs:


-values (Values2D):
(Class definition → Line 1) → values.getRowCount()
(Class definition → Line 3) → values.getValue(0, 0)
(Class definition → Line 5) → values.getValue(1, 0)


-column (Column index):
(Line 1 → Line 3) → values.getValue(0, 0)
(Line 1 → Line 5) → values.getValue(1, 0)


-total (The accumulator for the sum):
(Line 2 → Line 6) → total += n.doubleValue()
(Line 2 → Line 8) → total += n.doubleValue()
(Line 2 → Line 9) → return total


-r (Row index):
(Line 4 → Line 5) → values.getValue(r, column)
(Line 4 → Line 6) → total += n.doubleValue()


-n (Value retrieved from the Values2D object):
(Line 5 → Line 6) → n != null
(Line 5 → Line 6) → total += n.doubleValue()


Test Case 2: calculateColumnTotalForNullValues
Input: values with 0 rows (empty)


Execution Path:
Line 1: Mocking values.getRowCount() returns 0, meaning there are no rows.
Line 3: Since there are no rows, the method doesn't enter the loop.
Line 4: total remains 0.0 (initial value).
Line 9: The method returns 0.0.
Covered DU-Pairs:
-values (Values2D):
(Class definition → Line 1) → values.getRowCount()


-column (Column index):
(Line 1 → Line 3) → Skipped, no values to iterate over






-total (The accumulator for the sum):
(Line 2 → Line 9) → return total

# 3 A detailed description of the testing strategy for the new unit test

For our test plan, we will first add new methods that we did not previously test, as this is the easiest way to increase coverage. Then, we will move on to improving the test cases we already have for existing methods, leveraging the source code to deliberately target different branches, if-else statements, and edge cases that were previously untested. Prior to having the source code, we weren’t able to see all the conditions, but now we can design more precise and comprehensive test cases. This two-pronged approach testing new methods and enhancing existing test cases—ensures a significant and systematic increase in code coverage.


# 4 A high level description of five selected test cases you have designed using coverage information, and how they have increased code coverage
1. Test Case for getLowerBound - Illegal Argument Exception
Description: This test case checks if the getLowerBound method throws an IllegalArgumentException when an invalid range is provided (e.g., lowerBound > upperBound).

Coverage Increase: Previously, this scenario was untested, and the exception handling code was not covered. By adding this test case, we ensured that the exception-handling logic in getLowerBound is exercised, increasing coverage.

2. Test Case for getUpperBound - Illegal Argument Exception
Description: This test case verifies that the getUpperBound method throws an IllegalArgumentException when the range is invalid (e.g., upperBound < lowerBound).

Coverage Increase: Similar to getLowerBound, this scenario was not previously tested. The addition of this test case ensured that the exception-handling code in getUpperBound is executed, improving coverage.

3. Test Case for expandToInclude - Expansion Below Lower Bound
Description: This test case checks the behavior of expandToInclude when the value to be included is below the current lower bound of the range. It verifies that the range is correctly expanded to include the new lower value.

Coverage Increase: Previously, only expansion beyond the upper bound was tested. By adding this test case, we covered the logic for expanding the range below the lower bound, ensuring full coverage for this method.

4. Test Case for expandToInclude - Expansion Within Range
Description: This test case validates the behavior of expandToInclude when the value to be included already lies within the current range. It ensures that the range remains unchanged.

Coverage Increase: This scenario was not previously tested. By adding this test case, we covered the logic for handling values within the range, further increasing coverage for the expandToInclude method.

5. Test Case for equals - Comparison with Different Objects
Description: This test case checks the equals method by comparing the Range object with different types of objects (e.g., a non-Range object) and ensures that the method returns false in such cases.

Coverage Increase: The equals method was previously untested, showing no coverage at all. By adding this test case (and others for equals), we ensured that the method is fully tested, significantly increasing coverage for this part of the code.

# 6 Pros and Cons of coverage tools used and Metrics you report
Using the tool recommended which was EclEmma it was easy to get started with as we already had it installed on Eclipse. However upon use we saw EclEmma does not explicitly show statement and condition coverage which we ended up using method and line coverage instead. Overall it was easy to use and still provided us the tools to see how coverages changed for test cases.

# 7 A comparison on the advantages and disadvantages of requirements-based test generation and coverage-based test generation.
Over these last two assignments, we have been able to take a look a requirement-based (black-box) and coverage-based (white-box) testing. In terms of requirement-based testing, we looked at code documentation where each method had its requirements written out. Based on this we had to write test cases without looking at the actual source code, but rather develop test cases based on the method functionalities listed. Although this method was relatively simple to implement, due to not looking at the actual source code the chance of not covering edge cases is more likely hence a reduction in coverage.

Comparing this to coverage-based testing we can implement full coverage by analyzing the source code. By doing so we can make sure edge cases are covered. However, this method is more challenging and requires a deeper understanding of how the code functions. After using both methods we were able to see the advantages and disadvantages that come with each method of test generation.

# 8 A discussion on how the team work/effort was divided and managed
Compared to previous assignments we decided to split this one in a way everyone works over the same thing. For 3.2 we all worked together to create the data flow graphs and the respective tables. Furthermore, for the testing portion we all worked together to measure coverages and improve test cases. Using this method we were all able to work on everything and gain knowledge from each section. Furthermore, if we encountered any problems being able to collectivly brainstorm was very effective in solving any issuues.

# 9 Any difficulties encountered, challenges overcome, and lessons learned from performing the lab
During the time we were doing section 3.2 it was hard to understand how to obtain the def-use sets. However after coming together and some more research we were able to get it done. This lab allowed us the learn the concepts of white-box testing to imporove test case coverages and implement what we learned in the lectures to create data flow diagrams and DU-pairs.

# 10 Comments/feedback on the lab itself
As the start navigating through the lab was pretty hard and somehwat confusing. Since it was divided into different sections of what needed to be done, we had a hard time understanding at first. However, after coming together and carfully reviewing each step it became easier to navigate.
